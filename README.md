## To data or not to data, That is the question

"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous grammar,
Or to take arms against a datum of data
And by opposing end them..." 
- William "Data is Plural, okay?" Shakespeare

This project is unfinished.

## Launching the Application
The executable is located in the build\bin folder. There, you should find the application 'datum_inquisition_of_2023.exe'

You will be greeted with a picture wholly apolitical depiction of the Paris Datum Commune of 1871, where the Parisian Datumgnards fought valiantly against the forces of the pro-data-universalist military, wielding a counterrevolutionary tricolor who just can't let us have nice things like proper grammar. 

## What this application does
It prompts the user to confess their belief: "In the text you've pasted into to user_input.md, should the use of the word 'data' be considered heretical when it is used as a singular noun? (Y/N)"

If the user enters N, then the application will compliment the user with faint praise, saying that "I wish I could as careless as you about using the English language."

If the user enters Y, the application will analyze the text in the file and return all of the lines where there is an incorrect use of the word "data" is present... at least that is what was intended.

The application was intended to track two cases where the word "data" is used incorrectly:
1. "Data is..."
2. "... is data"

These basic rules are present in the 'vale_datum_rule' folder in the root directory. However, the integration of Vale to output in Wales has not been successfully completed.

## Source of the picture: 
From the graphic novel: Le Cri du peuple, which makes me wish I spoke French.
